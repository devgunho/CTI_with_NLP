## Reference

### # STIX / TAXI

> https://www.anomali.com/resources/what-are-stix-taxii

STIX and TAXII are standards developed in an effort to improve the prevention and mitigation of cyber-attacks.

STIX states the what of threat intelligence, while TAXII defines how that information is relayed. Unlike previous methods of sharing, STIX and TAXII are machine-readable and therefore easily automated.

### # MITRE ATT&CK®

> https://attack.mitre.org/

MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.
